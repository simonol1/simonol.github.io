<h1> Time and Habit Management </h1>

<p>I had a good read through the various habits and time management tools. I also stumbled across some interesting youtube videos on creating and breaking habits. BJ Fogg has an interesting Tedtalk about starting with tiny habits. Thomas Frank has an interesting video outlining lessons from Charles Duhigg's book "The Power of Habit" </p>
<p>At the moment I find that my attention span when learning is very short. I wil use the pomodoro technique maintain focus. I have found the toggl website very good for accountability.</p>
<p>I will come back to these concepts over the next few weeks and plan to find the most suitable ones for my style or learning and working. </p>

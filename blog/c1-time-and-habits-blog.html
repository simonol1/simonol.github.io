<h1> Habits & Time Management </h1>

<p>I had a good read through the various habits and time management tools. I also stumbled across some interesting youtube videos on creating and breaking habits. BJ Fogg has an interesting Tedtalk about starting with tiny habits and Thomas Frank has an interesting video outlining lessons from Charles Duhigg's book "The Power of Habit". </p>
<p>This week I have found it difficult to maintain focus for long periods of time. I've been much more productive doing short learning bursts and allowing myself to digest the new information. I'm currently trialing the pomodoro technique using my phone as the timer to see how it goes. I have found the toggl website very good for accountability and overall time management.</p>
<p>I will keep coming back to the concepts that I've read during the next few weeks and see if there are other techniques which are more suitable for my style of learning and working. I'm confident that I learn best kinethetically. </p>

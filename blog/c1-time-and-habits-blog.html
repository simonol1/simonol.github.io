<h1> <strong> Time and Habit Management </strong> </h1>

<p>I had a good read through the various habits and time management tools. I also stumbled across some interesting youtube videos on creating and breaking habits. BJ Fogg has an interesting Tedtalk about starting with tiny habits and Thomas Frank has an interesting video outlining lessons from Charles Duhigg's book "The Power of Habit". </p>
<p>At the moment I finding it difficult to maintain focus for long periods of time and find it much easier doing short bursts. I'm currently trialing the pomodoro technique using my phone as the timer to see how it goes. I have found the toggl website very good for accountability and overall time management.</p>
<p>I will come back to the concepts that I've read over the next few weeks and see if their are other techniques which are more suitable for my style of learning and working. </p>

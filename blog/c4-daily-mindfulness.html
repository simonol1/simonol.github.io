       <hr>
        <h5> What did I learn from my mindfulness conversation? How did the other person find it?</h5>
            <p>
               I became more aware of listening fully to what someone is saying and not trying to jump in too early with my interpretation. I found myself having to hold back from speaking, which was interesting. My attention wandered later in the conversation which I become aware of. I thought it was a great exercise and made me more aware of my listening skills...which I am quite frequently reminded of by my wife..The other person in the conversation was a coach in my team. He enjoyed the attention and genuine interest.
           </p>
        <h5> Which of the three suggested techniques would I use to sustain my practice?</h5>
            <p>
                I will try all three and see which one works best for me. Since starting to read 'search within youself' I have been mindful wherever possible...or when I remember which has slowed me down and make me much more appreciative of small things which I often take for granted. The three techniques are: Mindful conversation with a buddy, daily meditation for a shorted period than I think I can so it does not become a chore. The third is 'one breath', which relates to taking one mindful breath a day.
            </p>
         <h5> Any other musings?</h5>
            <p>
               Mindful coversation is an excellent skill. It involves 3 key parts: Mindful listening, looping and dipping. Mindful listening is ultimately giving the speaker your full attention. Looping is when we repeat what the speaker has said to make sure that we fully understand. The speaker will generally let us know if we have interpreted correctly, then we can relay this information back to them. Dipping is when we check in with ourselves while listening and acknowedge any internal chatter without judgement.

<h1> Reflection </h1>

<p>I'm really excited about this new journey. This first week has put things in perpective for me. I had no idea what I was in for before starting the course, even after talking others who has completed the course. It has been really interesting learning and problem solving, which I really enjoy doing...being a very competitive person that I am. In my previous role, I was really close to the top of the tree and had been for 10 years. Now I will be at the bottom in terms of my skill set and knowledge, which I'm sure will be difficult to swallow, but I'm certainly up for the challenge. I'm really looking forward to working closely with my Cohort. I'm used to working in the team, but this will be quite different I'm sure. The culture with EDA that I've experienced to far has been warm, friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to the next challenge! </p>

        <h5> Have I tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
            <p>
               Yes I've practiced most of the techniques at various times in my life to establish and maintain trust. In my previous work, I've used the technique of trusting someone until I have reason to believe otherwise, in other words giving someone the benefit of any doubt. I've reflected with others about embarassing moments or when I was in a vunerable situation. I've been empathetic of others opinions and issues, helping them where possible.
            </p>
        <h5> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
            <p>
               Yes this went really well. I certainly felt a deeper connection with the person when I was trying to read and relay back the feelings I felt from them while they are speaking. I will continue to practice this deep listening technique.
            </p>
        <h5> How did I find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
            <p>
               Fantastic meditation. I enjoyed the 'just like me' practice too, in which we remind ourselves how similar other people are to us, thereby creating the mental habit of equality. The 'loving kindness meditation' starts with resting our mind for a few minutes then inviting a feeling of kindness to ourself. We quietly repeat the following sentences to ourselves: May I be well...May I be happy...May I be free from suffering. After a minutes of this we invite this kind feeling towards someone we feel strongly towards, then we complete the same process for someone neutral and for someone we dislike or have difficulty with.

        <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
            <p>
               I had a coach, Jonty(for names sake), in my team who wanted to change the way we assessed our students. At the time I thought our current process was fair and provided us with the reporting we required. We held a general meeting with an open table to discuss key points. Jonty was very passionate about changing our process and firmly beleived that his recommended changes were the best pathway forward for the business and tennis students.
               <br>
               <br>
               This was an interesting discussion. The way that Jonty expressed his views was not very nice and really discredited the current way that we were doing things...emotion got in the way. After deliberation within our team we decided to take the best parts from each structure and create a new one.

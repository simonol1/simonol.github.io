        <h5> How did I find the process over product concept? </h5>
            <p>
               I had to keep saying to myself "process over product". I felt intimidated at the beginning of the week when a few of my fellow cohort posted amazing websites. I tried to take inspiration from them, but starting focusing too much on the product and quickly become very frustated by my inability to firstly design a site them implement. I spent alot of time on the product and not the process this week...steep learning curve.

        <h5> What did I think of Meditation before reading the 2nd chapter of 'search within yourself'? </h5>
            <p>
               These days everyone is in a hurry to get somewhere. People rarely stop and focus on the present moment without judgement. I frequently fall into this sinking ship. I think meditation is an amazing way to slow down and gain control of your mind. I try to practice on a daily basis when I have enough self control.. My understanding of meditation is: Mental training to improve attention awareness.
            </p>
        <h5> What new things have I learnt about meditation? </h5>
            <p>
               Happiness need not be pursued, but allowed. It is a default state of mind and meditation calms the mind to allow. I like the analogy of the gym and weight lifting. Everytime you lift a weight, the resistance increases muscle strength. Everytime your mind wanders and you bring it back to present you are building 'mental muscle' and improving your attention to the present moment.
            </p>
        <h5> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out for me? </h5>
            <p>
               Yeah - I like the process model which features the question before you start - what is my intention here? Why am I meditating? I also found the attitude concept good, adopting the 'grandmother mind' when talking to youself.
            </p>
        <h5> Any other musings? </h5>
            <p>
               The pursuit of happiness is interesting as are the studies conducted which show improvements in anxiety levels and immune system strength after 8 weeks of consistent meditation.

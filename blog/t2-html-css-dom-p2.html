           <h3> What is grid based design? </h3>
           <p> Grid based design is the concept of laying out a webpage using a grid. These grids are made up of columns and rows, which make it much easier to keep content organised and balanced. Typically pages are split up into 12 columns because the number 12 is divisable by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 & 12. </p>

           <h3> Whats all the hype about responsive web pages? </h3>
           <p> Responsive pages change size based on the users screen size. Many people now use phones and ipads to access web pages. These pages need to be clear and readable for the user, hence why responsive web pages have become a hit. </p>

        <h3> What is semantic structure? </h3>
        <p> A semantic element tells the browser and developer more about the content inside the tag than other elements. For example h1 is a semantic tag because it indicates that there is a large heading into the tag, where as div is non-semantic because it tells us nothing about what is inside the tag. </p>

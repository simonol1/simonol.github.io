        <h3> What learnings did I take away from the chapter? </h3>
            <p>
               Really interesting. The video from Chade-Meng Tan was very good and gave me a greater understanding of mind training and the process towards mastery. I find it amazing how quickly these skills can be developed. I particularly liked the analogy of the mind being the sky and the clouds being emotions.

        <h3> How did I find the 2 minutes of mindfulness? </h3>
            <p>
               I found the mindfulness really helpful. It is a great way to slow down and I've used it from time to time over the past 2 years when I've had the awareness to think "slow down". I'm currently trying to meditate for 5 minutes a day in the morning before I go to work. I find this a great way to start the day. Although sometimes my mind is difficult to slow and sometimes I just don't have time...funny that :). Slowly improving.

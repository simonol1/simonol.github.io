   <h3> How would I explain DOM, HTML & CSS to a non-technical friend? </h3>
<p>I would use the analogy of a house. The DOM is the section which the house is built on. The HTML is the structure of the building and the CSS is the furnishings; the colour of the walls, size of the cupboards and pictures on the walls.</p>
<h3> What is meant by boxifying text? </h3>
<p> The process of boxifying design is splitting a page into boxes to provide a clear lay out for the designer and user. </p>
<h3> What is the box model? </h3>
<p> The box model controls the layout of a webpage. Every HTML element is inside a box. The box model consists of content, padding, border, margin. The size of each of these can be adjusted using CSS </p>

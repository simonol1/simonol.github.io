<h2> Technical Blog 1 </h2>

<p> If I was explaining HTML to a non-technical friend. I would use the analogy of a car. The DOM is the engine, which powers the car, the HTML is the different parts of the car. ie: doors, seats, window wipers. The CSS is the way these part of the car look/their style. ie: The colour of car, colour of interior, size of mags etc. </p>

<p> The process of boxifying design is splitting a page into boxes to provide a clear lay out for the designer and user. </p>

<p> The box model controls the layout of a webpage. Every HTML element is inside a box. The box model consists of content, padding, border, margin. The size of each of these can be adjusted using CSS </p>

<h3> My wishlist </h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Create a menu bar </li>
<li> Overlapping boxes as seen in the screen filler design </li>
<li> Create animation </li>

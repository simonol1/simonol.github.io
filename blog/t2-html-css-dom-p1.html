               <h5> How would I explain DOM, HTML & CSS to a non-technical friend? </h5>
                 <p>
                    I would use the analogy of a house. The DOM is the section which the house is built on. The HTML is the structure of the building and the CSS is the furnishings; the colour of the walls, size of the cupboards and pictures on the walls.
                </p>
               <h5> What is meant by boxifying text? </h5>
                 <p>
                    The process of boxifying design is splitting a page into boxes to provide a clear lay out for the designer and user.
                 </p>
               <h5> What is the box model? </h5>
                 <p>
                    The box model controls the layout of a webpage. Every HTML element is inside a box. The box model consists of content, padding, border, margin. The size of each of these can be adjusted using CSS
                 </p>
               <h5> What is grid based design? </h5>
                  <p>
                    Grid based design is the concept of laying out a webpage using a grid. These grids are made up of columns and rows, which make it much easier to keep content organised and balanced. Typically pages are split up into 12 columns because the number 12 is divisable by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 & 12.
                 </p>
               <h5> Whats all the hype about responsive web pages? </h5>
                  <p>
                    Responsive pages change size based on the users screen size. Many people now use phones and ipads to access web pages. These pages need to be clear and readable for the user, hence why responsive web pages have become a hit.
                  </p>
                <h5> What is semantic structure? </h5>
                   <p>
                    semantic element tells the browser and developer more about the content inside the tag than other elements. For example h1 is a semantic tag because it indicates that there is a large heading into the tag, where as div is non-semantic because it tells us nothing about what is inside the tag.
             </p>
           <h5> My wishlist </h5>
               <p>
                 <ul class="wishlist">
                   <li> Create a menu bar </li>
                   <li> Home Button </li>
                   <li> Include grid based deign </li>
                   <li> Overlapping boxes as seen in the screen filler design </li>
                   <li> Create animation </li>
                 </ul>

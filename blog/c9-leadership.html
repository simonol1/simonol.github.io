       <h5> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
            <p>
              I've had a lot of experience as a leader and my general method of leading has always been to lead by example. In earlier years, I was very quick to make assumptions without collecting all of the relevant data and I might say was often not compassionate in giving feedback. With experience and more training I've improved these skills and I'm more comfortable discussing issues with staff, but it is never easy.

        <h5> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did I find it?</h5>
            <p>
              Yeah really good. I'll need to do more practice to experience it at a higher level, but I certainly felt good after completing it.
           </p>
        <h5> Do the Tonglen meditation. How did I find it?</h5>
            <p>
               I tried this meditation, but I found it really difficult. The part I found most difficult was to convert all of the negative feelings into positive ones by the time I needed to breath out. I just need to practice it more. I can see that this meditation would be really beneficial.

             <h5> How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp? </h5>
             <p>
                The scarf acronnym stands for: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness. Status has not had much influence over me in phase 0 and I doubt it will in bootcamp. I certainly want to be a great coder, but I understand that with my experience in this field it will take time to improve and at this stage I just want to make sure I'm on an even keel with my pairs. Certainty and Autonomy have influenced me in phase 0. Certainty in the way that 'I don't know if this is what I want to do?', 'what are the job prospects going to be?'. I'm feeling very uncertain about things at the moment, but I'm content to continue on the pathway and redirect my goals inline with this career change. Autonomy - well I have not had much of this during phase 0. I'm starting to become more autonomous with some of the exercises, but most of what I'm doing is in the early stages of learning, I suspect this will be similar in bootcamp, but it also contributes to uncetainty, so I really need to work harder to learn content faster. Relatedness - I've certainly felt this relatedness during phase 0. There are many in our cohort who are entering the world of coding for the first time and I feel like I can relate to the way they are feeling. I think when it comes to bootcamp this will be similar and I hope and plan to get on with everyone. We are all in it together for similar reasons. Learn new skills, meet new people and maybe have a career change. Really I do not see us competing against each other. Fairness in phase 0 has not been apparent. I've no reason to see anything as unfair and I hope the opportunities will be the same for everyone when we enter bootcamp.

             <h5> Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h5>
             <p>
                Yeah it went OK - I did some mindfulness before the conversation, attemping the multiplying goodness meditation. During the conversation I felt the 'fight or flight' response in me, but only at a low level..or maybe it was just some anxiety :). Afterwards I reflected on how I could have handled the conversation better.

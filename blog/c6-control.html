              <h5>When programming, what are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response? </h5>
               <p>
                  My trigger normally occurs when I cannot solve a problem, after working on it for some time and exhausting all perceivable options. I think overall mood, stress levels and self awareness have a huge influence on how disproportionate my response is. Sometimes I may not be able to understand something soon after learning it and this can trigger feelings of incompetence, frustration or anger on the odd occasion. Other times I may work on a problem for hours, not be able to find a solution and be content with it, then ask for help and still not find the solution... by that stage it's no longer OK and I'm pulling my hair out. The main trigger for me is when it feels like it should be working, but it's not!

             <h5> How did I find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
             <p>
                This is excellent. I sometimes find myself reacting too early in situations and let my emotions take over. I look forward to practicing this habit. It seems like a lot to get through in a short time frame. I like the focus on step 1, to 'stop'. Hopefully the other steps in the process will be more natural after that first step. However I can always refer back to the mnemonic: Siberian North Rail Road.

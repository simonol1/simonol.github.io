        <h5> What is a responsive site, why is it important? </h5>
            <p>
               A responsive site is one which adjusts it layout based on the size of the screen which the user is viewing it on. Responsive sites are important in this day and age because we view web pages on many different screen sizes and the users experience is very important for repeat visits.
           </p>
        <h5> What is a mobile first design?</h5>
            <p>
               A mobile first design is one which caters to the mobile user first. It is built with the mobile user in mind, then additional elements and features are added later.
            </p>
        <h5> What are frameworks and their pros and cons? </h5>
            <p>
               Frameworks provide the developer with a foundation to use. This foundation of code saves the developer time and money. The down side of using this is that the developer is less likely to fully understand the code and when it comes to making changes they may come up short. The developer can also be limited by the framework itself and options available to build within it.
            </p>
         <h5> What is a wireframe and why is important? </h5>
            <p>
               A wireframe is a 'blueprint' drawing of a web page. It provides the designer with a clearer picture of what the web page will look like and makes it easier for them to see the overall layout of the page before diving in to design.
            </p>
        <h5> What aspects of my wireframes did I have difficulty implementing? </h5>
             <p>
               Well I've had difficulty with most of the implementation, but it has been a good learning curve. I have had alot of HTML and CSS practice this week. The main difficulties I had was adding a nav bar and then changing the size of some font, but not all of it. This involved alot of adjustments. My next mission is to make my menu bar responsive and align the images below..

       <h5> Explain to a non-tech friend about how I got blocked on a simply problem</h5>
            <p>
               Well I've been blocked on a few simple problems recently, so there are many to pick from. This week I was trying to create a function which would show on a screen numbers, 1-1000, but each number that was divisible by 5 the function would show "Fizz" instead of the number and if the number was divisible by 3 the function would show "Buzz" instead...don't ask me why I was working on this, but it had me blocked for some time. Information is passing through me at the moment.
           </p>
        <h5> How I managed to solve a problem in an elegant way?</h5>
            <p>
               The problem above was solved using the hints provided under the question. I also searched on google to see what other answers there were. I've since downloaded a app called 'javascript anywhere' so that I can practice writting functions.
           </p>
        <h5> Reflect on how confident I am on using the following problem solving techniques:</h5>
            <p>
               Pseudocode: Yes, this is very helpful to really understand a problem. It involves writing part code and part 'english' to identify what is required.
            </p>
            <p>
               Trying something: Yes I had many occasions so far, in which I've tried something and it hasn't worked. I'm very confortable trying out different combinations to try and find the right result.
            </p>
            <p>
               Rubber ducky method: I haven't used this method yet, but I can see how it will be helpful and I'm sure I will using it in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
               Reading error messages: I'm starting to get the hang of these. I find it useful to bring up dev tools and try and isolate the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
               Console.logging: Yes I normally check this out in the dev tools.
            </p>
             <p>
               Googling: Yes I'm confortable doing this and if often my first point of call.
             </p>
             <p>
               Asking your peers for help: Yes, happy to ask my peer group. I was probably guilty of going to them too early in the first couple of weeks, without exhausting other options first...must be good for their ego though.
             </p>
             <p>
               Asking coaches for help: Yes I'm happy to ask my coach for assistance if I get completely stuck. I'm sure he very busy so I would need to be completely blocked and not be getting any assistance from my fellow Hihis.
             </p>
             <p>
                Improving my process with reflection: Yes I'm a big believer in reflection and I learn through reflection where ever possible. If I was better discplined I would keep a daily diary...one of my future missions.
             </p>
             <h5> Explain to a non-tech friend what the below functions do. </h5>
             <p>
               .map(): This creates a new array with the results of calling a function.
             </p>
             <p>
               .filter(): This function removes any varibles from an array which do not remain true when the main function is run. For example: The array may hold numbers 1-10 and 15, 17 and 20. The function only runs for numbers 1-10, therefore the filter removes these numbers.
             </p>
             <p>
               .reduce() This function adds all numbers in the function up and reduces them to one number.

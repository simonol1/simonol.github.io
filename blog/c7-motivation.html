              <h5> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
                <p>
                   I really enjoyed reading this chapter. Perhaps a 'aha' moment in some respects. I think I fall into the same trap as many, dedicating too much time to pleasure and letting my ego take over...impulsive in some ways. I have been fortunate to coach tennis as my daily job for the last 12 years, which is a huge passion of mine and a great source of enjoyment. This service I've been providing can also be a 'higher purpose' in some ways. I've been teaching children and adults; self-discpline, good physical habits, to control their emotions and think tactically under pressure. I've got to the point where I want a complete change though. No doubt I will be back coaching on a part time basis sometime in the future. Back to the question, what does life look like? Well when we constantly chase pleasure we are only ever happy for a short time, we crave that next hit of pleasure and quite often its never enough. When we pursue life through a passion we can maintain our focus and enjoyment for much longer, but evenually we can become bord. Life through the 'higher purpose' lens is selfless, but fulfilling. We are focused on achieving something bigger than ourselves, something for others and we find that our ego is alleviated and can maintain and enjoy consistent happiness...Let's find out :)

              <h5> From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are my core values?</h5>
                <p>
                  My core values are: Integrity, patience, loyalty and humour.
                </p>
              <h5> What do you stand for?</h5>
                <p>
                   Tricky question. I have never thought of this... I stand for not taking yourself too seriously, enjoying life, taking care of family and friends, treating others the way that you want to be treated. Being the best person I can be....recognising that I can always be better, learning every day!
                </p>
              <h5> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
                <p>
                   Yeah really good. It is amazing the power of the mind to be able to think back to a time of failure of success and almost relive it.
                </p>
              <h5> Any other musings?</h5>
                <p>
                   Great chapter! I really like the steps to motivation.
                   1. Alignment: Aligning our work with our values or higher purpose.
                   2. Envisioning: Visualizing our desired future for ourselves.
                   3. Resilience: The ability to overcome obstacles in our way.

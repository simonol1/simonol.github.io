        <h5> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness</h5>
            <p>
               Being mindful is also being self-aware. I found this chapter really interesting, particularly the part about self awareness to self confidence...deep self-knowledge and blatant self-honestly. In other words, knowing your strengths and weaknesses really well will build your self confidence.
           </p>
        <h5> I tried a practice called 'body scanning'...how did I find it?</h5>
            <p>
               I found this really good. It wasd helpful to have something to focus my attention on while I was meditating. When I reached my feet, I felt like I was in a trance. I'm planning to start using this practice while I'm lying in bed trying to go to sleep.
            </p>
        <h5> What did I take away from the 'My Emotions not me' section?</h5>
            <p>
              Interesting article. I've been thinking about how I experience my emotions at the moment and I will often say "I" before the emotion. The insight to say 'I'm experiencing anger' sounds like something a sociopath might say with total detachment from emotions, but maybe I've just watched too many movies. I see how this will be beneficial and I'll certainly work towards this amazing insight and self awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
               Treat the ego with humour...let it be small enough that 'self' is not important and big enough that I'm comfortable in most situations.
